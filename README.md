## Boilerplate code for Go Projects
My preferred starting structure for mid-/large-sized Go projects.

## Features

* Go 1.4
* Using GVM and GVP to manage dependent packages
* Cross-compile to Mac, Linux and Windows

## Bootstrap
Setup the Go development environment.

### Mac OS X

```bash
./bootstrap.darwin.sh
```

### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo ./bootstrap.linux.sh
```

### Vagrant

```bash
vagrant up
```
